# Public Invention Project Chatbot

This is a current project to create a project-recommending ChatBot for [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) site users. It will be an interactive tool which will provide more details about projects, share which are currently active, and advise of which projects to join based on a given skillset or interest. Once complete, this project will be placed on the Public Invention website to aid prospective volunteers with navigating the website and project database.

# Development

## February 2025

Robert Read and Mairin O'Grady met with Daniel Lindenberger to open the Project Chatbot project. Began with a demonstration and tips on how to create a customized chatbot. O'Grady and Read created a first version using the project datasheet to feed the ChatGPT bot information. From there, it could successfully provide details about projects when prompted.

## March 2025

The project was picked up in March of 2025, with the additional mission to make the chatbot recommend some projects before others based on:

1. Priority
2. Active Status

The team ran into issues with the recommendation rankings, and so far the additional configuration has not been successful. 

## October 2025

In October of 2025, the project was reopened for further updates, and/or to be implemented on the Public Invention website. Awaiting further updates.
